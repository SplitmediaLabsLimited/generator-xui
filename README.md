# generator-xui

This is a Yeoman Generator for scaffolding an XSplit plugin using the [XUI Framework](https://github.com/SplitmediaLabsLimited/xui).

# Generating an XUI based Plugin
1. Verify that Yeoman is installed

```shell
npm install -g yo
```
2. Install the xui generator

```shell
npm install -g generator-xui
```
3. Create a new plugin folder

```shell
mkdir YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME
cd YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME
```
4. Execute our yo generator

```shell
yo xui
```

That shall scaffold the basic structure of an XSplit plugin for you.
