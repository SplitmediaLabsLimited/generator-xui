     * Hi! Thanks for using XUI Framework :)
     *
     * XUI exposes useful methods to work with XSplit without fiddling too much
     * with the raw core methods exposed to JavaScript, which makes developing
     * plugins for XSplit a lot easier.
     *
     * There are two main namespaces that is avialable for you to use:
     * 1. xui.core
     * 2. xui.system
     *
     * You can read more about it at our documentation:
     * http://splitmedialabslimited.github.io/xui/docs/
